X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>In the era of containers and other dynamic platforms, management of entry points is becoming a great challenge,
with the large amounts of application deployments requiring entry points to update often.<br />
And the patterns for routing, blue / green or canary, are challenging to scale.<br />
You want secured HTTPS requests on your applications, while ensuring certificates are up to date on these ephemeral URLs,
thus requiring a lot of plumbing.</p>
<p>Learn how to overcome this complexity, and successfully build reliable entry points, focusing your energy on what matters to you.</p>
<p>Our session will define what a modern edge router, reverse proxy and load-balancer are, from Traefik;s point of view.<br />
We will then present concepts and advanced features which overcome the platform entry point challenges.<br />
And finally, we&rsquo;ll dig deeper and show how we can scale these solutions and make them fault tolerant.<br />
We look forward to the Q &amp; A section and chatting those who have questions around dynamic configuration,
Ingress Controllers and with those who wish to learn how Traefik helps developers build the best infrastructure with ease.</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>When you&rsquo;re managing distrubyted applications you&rsquo;re probably using a variety of tools that serve specific purposes.<br />
Terraform, Helm, Compose, CloudFormation, Pulumi, ARM templates, etc. No one tool solves all your needs.<br />
And new tools come along regularly. But all tools tend to invent there own packaging.</p>
<p>In this talk we&rsquo;ll introduce the Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB) specification, and some associated tooling.<br />
CNAB embraces the multi-tool world and allows for packaging up multiple formats and their accompanying toolchains into a single artefact.</p>
<p>Imagine a single installable package that contains Terraform code to launch an RDS instance and a Compose file or
Helm charts describing the application that will use it.<br />
Today you might package and distribute those separately, with CNAB you can keep them together.</p>
<p>That means we can share metadata, cryptographically sign a single artefact, push all aspects of the application to a central registry and more.</p>
<p>In this talk we&rsquo;ll introduce CNAB, discuss some of the problems it solves, and show demos of the accompanying tooling.</p>

along dies the whole application resulting in revenue loss for the company.</p>
<p>Starting there, I would like to describe how we approached the unknown issue, assumptions, failure, trial and error,
until we found the root cause: a known bug in the respective version of the famous distributed software.<br />
Of course, every software has bugs and hitting a major one is not such uncommon but more than that,
what is actually important is the actual lessons learnt during the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>how do we monitor our infrastructure and ways to improve it</li>
<li>what actually happens inside our application, how do failures of external software affect it, how we can improve stability</li>
<li>tools we have Vs tools we need, call for more automation</li>
<li>what are the actual resources we need for our use case, if we under/overprovision, understand our scale and optimize the costs</li>
<li>importance of documentation and post-mortems, the 5 WHYs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Major takeaway of this talk:
tackle your incidents as a way to understand more about your systems
(both technical systems: infra, code, tools AND non-technical systems: teams, workflows, procedures, practices) and design them better.</p>

Virtual machines for the training labs have gone from manual provisioning through managed by Foreman to Vagrant to get even more flexibility.<br />

Security compliance is a state where computer systems are scrutinized against certain defined security policy.<br />
OpenSCAP is one such security compliance ecosystem that provides multiple tools to assist administrators and auditors
with assessment, measurement, and enforcement of security baselines.<br />
Foreman provides OpenSCAP as a plugin that enables Foreman to receive automated vulnerability assessment and
security compliance audits from Foreman hosts. You can upload SCAP compliance contents,
create compliance policies out of them and further, these policies can be assigned to various hosts or hostgroups created through foreman.<br />
OpenSCAP reports will help users find vulnerabilities on the hosts and also suggest remediation plan to fix those vulnerabilities.<br />
Foreman OpenSCAP plugin is made of 4 components viz., foreman_openscap, smart_proxy_openscap, foreman_scap_client and puppet-foreman_scap_client.<br />
These components together establish the Foreman and OpenSCAP integration.</p>

 The talk will start with what a Unikernel is, an overview of the Unikernel landscape and their different characterist.<br />
Where are they heading?<br />
An interesting development is happening with Unikernels sneaking their way onto Linux systems and playing hand-in-hand with more traditional systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll demo a couple of Unikernel applications.<br />

load-balancing, health checks, etc.
Before those products became available, there were already available solutions to handle those constraints.</p>
<p>Among them is Hystrix, a Java library provided by Netflix.<br />
From the site: &ldquo;Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems,
services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.&rdquo;<br />
In particular, Hystrix provides an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern,
which prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services. But now Istio also provides the same capability.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will have a look at how Istio and Hystrix implement the Circuit Breaker pattern, and what pros/cons each of them has.</p>
<p>After this talk, you&rsquo;ll be able to decide which one is the best fit in your context.</p>

once you have more than a couple of servers or containers,
SSH and tail will not serve you well any more.<br />
However, the common question or struggle is how to achieve that.</p>
<p>This talk presents multiple approaches and patterns with their advantages and disadvantages,
so you can pick the one that fits your organization best:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parse: Take the log files of your applications and extract the relevant pieces of information.</li>
<li>Send: Add a log appender to send out your events directly without persisting them to a log file.</li>
<li>Structure: Write your events in a structured file, which you can then centralize.</li>
<li>Containerize: Keep track of short lived containers and configure their logging correctly.</li>
<li>Orchestrate: Stay on top of your logs even when services are short lived and dynamically allocated on Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each pattern has its own demo with the open source Elastic Stack (previously called ELK Stack),
so you can easily try out the different approaches in your environment.<br />
Though the general patterns are applicable with any centralized logging system.</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY>
<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re working to put in place a Rudder policy that covers all OS that we support at our customers,
or that will be coming around (i.e. beta of a new version).</p>
<p>For our managed systems, it should cover distro-/OS-specific settings and that &ldquo;what makes sense everywhere, will be applied everywhere&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For our human eyes, it should have a clear design that allows for easy understanding and maintenance.</p>
<p>Rudder offers many options to express little details in the policy.<br />
We need to find a best practice for quickly choosing the simplest option, which is least likely to require redesign.</p>
<h3 id="experiences">Experiences</h3>
<ul>
<li>managing kernel module blacklists, managing sysctls</li>
<li>configuring auditd to be safe and lightweight</li>
<li>mixing globally applicable and os-specific Rudder rules</li>
<li>using ncf sys knowledge to abstract OS-specific package and service names out of the policy</li>
<li>independent testing of compliance using Lynis and monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>** why? because if we (flawed human) design the policy, we (same flawed human) should not design the final test :-) **</p>
<h3 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll wrap it up with practical stuff like configuring OSSEC and why nsjail is awesome as a containment technology for services.<br />
We can help our colleagues and ourselves securing many applications, with a much better learning curve than SElinux etc. got.</p>
<p>So when you walk in the room and listen you get rough idea of sustainable policy design but also of what a sec policy looks like,
if it&rsquo;s not only made to fill a checklist.</p>

DESCRIPTION;ALTREP="https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/tuesday/devopsupport/":Support at scale in a DevOps world: how Swarming and Cynefin can save you from 3rd Line hell
X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>As DevOps practices and modern software defined infrastructure become increasingly established in enterprises,
and as the scale of delivery grows, practitioners increasingly find themselves drawn into traditional IT support structures.<br />
Here, they find themselves expected to act as part of a classic multi-tier support structure,
with at least part of their time spent acting as a 3rd line support function.</p>
<p>This presentation explores the problems this creates:
its siloed nature creates inefficient work-in-progress queues,
and reduces cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>Service Management plays a vital role in managing system consumers at scale,
but it needs to modernise to work well in the new era.<br />
Hence, this presentation explores emergent methods such as Swarming,
and new thinking such as Cynefin, which bring new thinking and new structures which align much better to modern development and operations thinking.</p>

What can we learn from that, and what do we need from configuration management to get these features and metrics?</p>
<p>Logs from installation is a good start, but they need centralization, aggregation and especially knowledge derivation from these -
but also we need to observe these features over time, to trace changes, and correlate them with monitoring.</p>
<p>Rudder was built around the predicate that all actions of the configuration agent need to be traced,
centralized and exposed in a meaningful way - with agents ensuring the continuous configuration of systems,
and this talk will show the rationale behind this predicate, how we implemented this solution,
and the benefits of this approach for the modern IT world.</p>

but the configuration management tools aren&rsquo;t keeping up.<br />
As the number of Kubernetes clusters you run grows,
your ability to install components on them with slight and subtle differences becomes more and more manual.</p>
<p>kr8 is designed to take the heavy lifting out of this,
by allowing you to manipulate yaml with a first class data templating language (jsonnet) without all the overhead of similar tools.<br />
It follows the principles of simplicity you&rsquo;d expect from a bunch of admins writing a tool,
while still allowing the power and flexibility to get what you need done.</p>
<p>This talk will go over the inspiration behind kr8,
as well as show a practical demo and example of deploying the components
you choose to multiple clusters with the modifications needed in a few lines of code.</p>

YAML currently rules all around us.
But what if you could write and maintain configuration in a high-level programming language and
simply generate the configuration for your YAML-hungry application? What if that language was Typescript?
In this talk we&rsquo;ll quickly introduce TypeScript (Familiar syntax! Types! Fantastic IDE integrations!) and
show a few examples of making a YAML-based configuration file more exciting.
We&rsquo;ll also discuss how that facilitates powerful sharing and reuse of configuration,
and even creating your own higher-level abstractions.</p>

Helm pushes hard saying that YAML with some parameters that runtime get translated to a variable is a flexible and maintainable approach.<br />

I had all of those questions and many more.<br />
Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role and
a DevOps team has been a fascinating journey.<br />
I&rsquo;d like to share the lessons I learned along the way and encourage more people to blur the traditional lines.</p>
<p>What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from unconventional background?
- How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles?
- How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management?</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>RFC-1 was published 50 years ago.  Infrastructure management emerged as a discrete field two decades later, and devops a decade after that.  As we work to realize the full potential of networked computing and the decentralized organizations it enables, what will the next 50 years bring, and what can we do to hurry things along?</p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll touch on some of the roots of current infrastructure management tools and the motivation and computing science theory behind them.  We&rsquo;ll attempt to reconcile some long-lasting disconnects by referring to current thinking in distributed consensus systems.  Finally, we’ll (carefully) extrapolate forward to see what the community likely will be working on between now and mid-century, and we’ll announce some new initiatives in that direction.</p>
