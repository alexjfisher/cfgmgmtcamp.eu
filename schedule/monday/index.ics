DESCRIPTION:“Docker, Docker, Docker, Docker, …”, developers really love Docker.
Usually one sees the no longer need for configuration management, the easy way to spin up a platform on a laptop, the low resource footprint. But how do you deploy laptops in data centers?
This talk will give you an insight how we (more Ops then Dev) started to learn (and love) containers, the issues we saw when running them in larger scale and how Ops people should start dealing with Container technologies.

DESCRIPTION:In the agile, lean, devops communities people talk about improving security by “shifting left”.
Patterns and tools are emerging, or re-emerging, that make security less of a pain in the development process while also making applications more secure.
I will cover tools and processes that help teams with the day to day work like code scanners, application scanners, pull requests, deployment tooling and infrastructure-as-code.
At the organisational level some relatively small changes to, for instance, the change approval process can have a big impact.
These are tools and processes that have proven themselves at many organisations and perhaps they can do the same for you.

DESCRIPTION:Choria is a 2 year old project that started life as an easy route to using MCollective for open source Puppet users.
It has evolved to encompass a number of technologies related to large scale systems management and have been deployed on globe spanning sites with 100s of thousands of nodes and thousands of daily active users.
This talk will give an update on the projects status, progress, and will explore some of the new technologies created in this project.
With the arrival of Puppet 6 in fall 2018 Puppet Inc has officially deprecated The Marionette Collective and have donated the legacy MCollective code bases to the Choria project.
We will explore what options Puppet 6 users have for benefiting from their past investments in the MCollective platform and look at work done that will be of particular interest to Puppet users such as orchestrating nodes using the Puppet DSL using Choria Playbooks.

DESCRIPTION: Intro We’re working to put in place a Rudder policy that covers all OS that we support at our customers, or that will be coming around (i.e. beta of a new version).
For our managed systems, it should cover distro-/OS-specific settings and that “what makes sense everywhere, will be applied everywhere”.
For our human eyes, it should have a clear design that allows for easy understanding and maintenance.
Rudder offers many options to express little details in the policy.
We need to find a best practice for quickly choosing the simplest option, which is least likely to require redesign.
Experiences  managing kernel module blacklists, managing sysctls configuring auditd to be safe and lightweight mixing globally applicable and os-specific Rudder rules using ncf sys knowledge to abstract OS-specific package and service names out of the policy independent testing of compliance using Lynis and monitoring  ** why? because if we (flawed human) design the policy, we (same flawed human) should not design the final test :-) **
Takeaway We’ll wrap it up with practical stuff like configuring OSSEC and why nsjail is awesome as a containment technology for services.
We can help our colleagues and ourselves securing many applications, with a much better learning curve than SElinux etc. got.
So when you walk in the room and listen you get rough idea of sustainable policy design but also of what a sec policy looks like, if it’s not only made to fill a checklist.

DESCRIPTION:Cron, a popular tool for scheduling jobs, has been used by millions of people on millions of servers around the world for several years.
As servers become less like pets and more like cattle, jobs can no longer be tied to a specific server and a scheduling system must be flexible to allow jobs to easily be scheduled across multiple servers, quickly moved from one server to another, and easily report on the status of a scheduled job.
Salt Stack, is at its heart, a remote execution system which also does configuration management very well.
This presentation will demonstrate how Salt can be used to replace Cron for command scheduling and fulfill these modern requirements.
The talk will include:
 A brief introduction to Salt Stack Examples of how to schedule jobs using Salt Stack. Using the Salt State system to scheduling jobs with dependencies. Using Salt Returners to receive notifications on job status. With Salt’s remote execution modules, how to centrally manage jobs across many servers.

DESCRIPTION:Golang as a language has exploded with popularity since it’s first release in 2009.
It’s now the langauage behind a number of applications core to most organisations operations, such as Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes and etcd.
However, for most people used to scripting interpreted languages like Ruby and Python, it can be a bit hard to get started with. What’s all this err != nil business, and why am I getting errors when I don’t refer to a variable?
In this talk, we’ll be discussing how to learn enough Golang to get into trouble, or at least enough to contribute fixes and features to your favourite infra management tools and apps, with an example of adding a new feature to the Vault Terraform Provider, and the gotcha’s you might experience along the way.

DESCRIPTION:Microservice security is too hard.
We must issue and rotate TLS certificates, deploy identity providers, and embed auth logic in applications.
These all require secure development, test, and maintenance effort.
Istio (a Google, IBM, and Lyft project) offers a new way: by providing a service mesh and a unified identity for each request, it offers all these things with zero application changes.
In this talk we detail:
 What a service mesh is, and why Istio could revolutionise microservices Increasing application security and availability using network RBAC and circuit breakers Why all applications should use encryption by default “Free” mutual TLS between all services and rotate certs every hour Preventing token replay attacks that plague JWT Securely delegating requests between microservices  URL:https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/istio/

DESCRIPTION:The CERN IT infrastructure consists of more than 40000 Puppet-managed virtual and physical machines located in two data centers.
Many Puppet catalogs contain configuration that depends on sensitive data which has to be centrally managed but accessible only by the relevant machines.
In order to distribute the secrets to hosts via Puppet, we developed a system that provides Puppet resources that fetch secrets at catalog application time and a CLI for managing them.
This presentation will explain how this system works and how it is integrated with our configuration management stack, its limitations and future developments.

DESCRIPTION:Have you longed for a simple yet powerful way to automate workloads on Kubernetes?
Ansible, the familiar IT automation tool, makes it easier than ever to automate your cluster.
This talk introduces two practical ways to define and provision complex applications using Ansible Automation with Kubernetes.
The Automation Broker allows users to leverage Ansible Automation to define and orchestrate applications, making them available for self-service provisioning in the Service Catalog.
The Ansible Operator allows users to actively manage the full lifecycle of an application by defining management behaviors with Ansible; the Operator handles everything else.
In this session you will learn: - How to define and deploy your application on Kubernetes using Ansible. - How to publish your own applications in the Kubernetes Service Catalog. - How to create a Kubernetes Operator using Ansible.

DESCRIPTION:So, there is case, every once in a few days the kafka cluster dies and along dies the whole application resulting in revenue loss for the company.
Starting there, I would like to describe how we approached the unknown issue, assumptions, failure, trial and error, until we found the root cause: a known bug in the respective version of the famous distributed software.
Of course, every software has bugs and hitting a major one is not such uncommon but more than that, what is actually important is the actual lessons learnt during the process:
 how do we monitor our infrastructure and ways to improve it what actually happens inside our application, how do failures of external software affect it, how we can improve stability tools we have Vs tools we need, call for more automation what are the actual resources we need for our use case, if we under/overprovision, understand our scale and optimize the costs importance of documentation and post-mortems, the 5 WHYs.  Major takeaway of this talk: tackle your incidents as a way to understand more about your systems (both technical systems: infra, code, tools AND non-technical systems: teams, workflows, procedures, practices) and design them better.

DESCRIPTION:This talk will show a uncommon case study for Foreman at NETWAYS.
Our training schedule is fully packed with public and in-house training courses and having many different topics requires us to change training environments quite often and in short time to get them to different locations.
Moving away from golden images to Foreman and Puppet has enabled our Events team to provision training environments independently from technical stuff.
The Discovery Plugin allows to use the same process for handling rental notebooks for in-house training courses and big conference.
Virtual machines for the training labs have gone from manual provisioning through managed by Foreman to Vagrant to get even more flexibility.
And the latest step to reduce the need for re-provisioning is by using LVM snapshots and downloading Virtual Machine images from the cloud.

DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes with Kubevirt is the uprising solution for unified management of virtual machines and containers.
Foreman is well known as a complete life cycle systems management tool for provisioning, configuring and monitoring of physical and virtual servers.
The talk will focus on the newly added support for Kubevirt in Foreman which allows provisioning and configuration of Virtual Servers on top of Kubernetes with Kubevirt.
After describing the use-cases and the supported functionality provided by the integration, I intend to show a demo that combines all of the pieces and the interaction between them.
The demo will show how a virtual server is being created from Foreman, adding a VM on KubeVirt compute resource and provision its OS from PXE.
The setup is a bit complex due to the nature of the moving parts and those will be explained as well prior to the demo.

DESCRIPTION:As DevOps practices and modern software defined infrastructure become increasingly established in enterprises, and as the scale of delivery grows, practitioners increasingly find themselves drawn into traditional IT support structures.
Here, they find themselves expected to act as part of a classic multi-tier support structure, with at least part of their time spent acting as a 3rd line support function.
This presentation explores the problems this creates: its siloed nature creates inefficient work-in-progress queues, and reduces cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Service Management plays a vital role in managing system consumers at scale, but it needs to modernise to work well in the new era.
Hence, this presentation explores emergent methods such as Swarming, and new thinking such as Cynefin, which bring new thinking and new structures which align much better to modern development and operations thinking.

DESCRIPTION:Switching out the back bone of your automation tool chain is usually painful.
It likely involves rewriting all your infrastructure code, and will either require a scary over-night cut-off, or a period in which two tools run concurrently, with operators carefully shifting functionality one step at a time.
With mgmt’s support for Puppet code, migrating becomes a lot more natural.
This session does a deep dive and shows how mgmt will allow you to use and maintain a mixed code base of both Puppet’s and mgmt’s DSLs.

DESCRIPTION:Systems left with unpatched vulnerabilities can have a number of consequences.
Security compliance is a state where computer systems are scrutinized against certain defined security policy.
OpenSCAP is one such security compliance ecosystem that provides multiple tools to assist administrators and auditors with assessment, measurement, and enforcement of security baselines.
Foreman provides OpenSCAP as a plugin that enables Foreman to receive automated vulnerability assessment and security compliance audits from Foreman hosts. You can upload SCAP compliance contents, create compliance policies out of them and further, these policies can be assigned to various hosts or hostgroups created through foreman.
OpenSCAP reports will help users find vulnerabilities on the hosts and also suggest remediation plan to fix those vulnerabilities.
Foreman OpenSCAP plugin is made of 4 components viz., foreman_openscap, smart_proxy_openscap, foreman_scap_client and puppet-foreman_scap_client.
These components together establish the Foreman and OpenSCAP integration.

DESCRIPTION:Real-time, autonomous, automation.
Mgmt is a real-time automation tool that is fast and safe.
As we get closer to a 0.1 release that we’ll recommend as “production ready”, we’ll look at the last remaining features that we’re aiming to land by then.
We’ll explain and demo the import and module system, classes, and native functions.
It uses a real-time, reactive programming language to model the desired state over time, and a powerful event-driven engine to apply this state.
We’ll also show some exciting real-time demos that include scheduling, finite state machines, and remote execution.
Finally we’ll talk about some of the future designs we’re planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.

SUMMARY:Scaling and monitoring your puppetserver for thousands of clients - including all pitfalls!

DESCRIPTION:Throwing hardware on your Puppetserver to scale it vertically works up to a certain level.
But how do you proceed once you reach the limit?
How do you distribute your agents over several Puppetservers evenly, but without hardcoded assignments?
How do you handle the massively increased load on your Foreman and PuppetDB intances, after the Puppetserver isn’t the bottleneck anymore?
And how the heck can this all be monitored?
I would like to show you a walkthrough from a small environment with a single physical server for Puppetserver/Foreman/PostgreSQL and a handful of agents that got scaled up to several thousand agents.
This also includes probably all common pitfalls that you can find yourself in on this journey!

SUMMARY:Applying SOLID principles to Infrastructure as Code

DESCRIPTION:S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, in the early 2000s.
These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily re-factor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.
This talk discusses our options how we can model puppet code while applying the SOLID principles.
As the puppet DSL is not a object oriented language we will also address the limitations of the design pattern, which we ll have to solve using the convention over configuration design pattern.

DESCRIPTION:Infrastructure as code is a proven pattern, and so is open source. Wouldn’t it make sense to bring a community driven approach to operational code itself?
This talk is about bringing those ideas together, to create effective open source communities for operational code on Kubernetes and on traditional machine or cloud environments.
Collaborating on complex infrastructure, and using open source to share the benefits of that collaboration, will enable us all to spend more time focused on the things which are truly different about our challenges and less on the problems we all share.

DESCRIPTION:Stream processing technologies are usually associated with social media, click streams, machine learning and big data however this talk will show it can be useful in solving difficult problems operations face when dealing with large server estates.
A very large scale stream processing pipeline have been built managing metadata for 100s of thousands of nodes using technologies from Choria.io and NATS.io, this talk will explore the design, performance and potential uses of such a platform.
Areas covered:
 basic streaming overview design of the global network design of a replication tool particular to the needs building hierarchical cached views of the estate exposing data to other systems with examples using stream processing methodologies to perform real time analysis and remediation of the fleet  We;ll also explore how this is a good parallel for IoT where the mentioned node scale is considered small.
While this talk demonstrates a platform built using specific technologies and the design of those will influence the talk, it’s not a vendor talk and we’ll make efforts so the ideas are transferred and not the glossies from any one tool.

DTSTART:20190204T150000
DTEND:20190204T155500
DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes provides a declarative API, so you can describe the desired state of the system and then the control plane makes the actual state match the desired state.
But we still need config mgmt for API objects to the point when they are applied to the cluster.
Helm helps organizing these configs into charts, template them, and manage releases.
GitOps let’s you use a git repo as a single source of truth for the desired state of the whole system.
Then all changes to this state are delivered just as git commits instead of using kubectl apply or helm upgrade.
In this talk I will introduce the GitOps model for operating cloud native environments and give a short demo.

DESCRIPTION:To borrow a phrase, “In the beginning was the command line.” Then we had ISConf and CFEngine, and things were good… for a while.
Puppet and Chef came along, embodying the idea that infrastructure code should behave like application code. More recently, Ansible brought the concept of idempotent resources to imperative workflows, but stops short of modelling in favor of radical simplicity.
Now we’re wondering: is it possible to get the best of both worlds?
Can we get model-based guarantees plus orchestrated action?
I think the answer is “yes” and in this talk I will explore an emerging “fourth generation” of config management tools that attempt to bring the beneficial properties of models together with orchestrated action. In full disclosure, I’ll talk about Puppet’s Bolt and Lyra projects, but the talk will not be vendor-specific as tools like Terraform and OpsMop also exemplify this approach.

Come and discover how we linked the monitoring, queuing systems and orchestration to do unattended incident management.
One of the main advantages of this is that we can apply technical remediation or mitigation from business metrics, even if things happen at different levels.
All of this working anywhere Prometheus and ansible run, so not only in a kube env, but also in a traditional infrastructure.

DTSTART:20190204T93000
DTEND:20190204T102500
DESCRIPTION:Distributed systems, microservices, containers and schedulers, polyglot persistence …
modern infrastructure is ever more fluid and dynamic, chaotic and transient.
Likewise, individual engineering roles can no longer be broken down neatly into
software engineers (who write the code) and ops engineers (who deploy the code (and buffer the consequences)).
Many teams have already sailed past an event horizon of complexity and found that their old tools and processes no longer work for them.
But why, exactly?
What was wrong with traditional metrics and logs?
Why are they failing to keep pace with modern requirements?
Isn’t observability just a marketing term for monitoring? And what on earth can we do about it?
In this talk we’ll cover the shortcomings of traditional metrics and logs, and the technical and cultural differences between monitoring and observability.
We’ll also talk about the deep cultural revolution underway from siloed specialties towards software ownership (in every type of engineering role) – and what exactly does that mean when it comes to systems observability? – as well as the technical practices and mental shifts that are absolutely required to keep pace with modern infrastructure.

DTSTART:20190204T173000

DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes in general, and Istio in particular, have changed a lot the way we look at Ops-related constraints: monitoring, load-balancing, health checks, etc. Before those products became available, there were already available solutions to handle those constraints.
Among them is Hystrix, a Java library provided by Netflix.
From the site: “Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.”
In particular, Hystrix provides an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern, which prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services. But now Istio also provides the same capability.
In this talk, we will have a look at how Istio and Hystrix implement the Circuit Breaker pattern, and what pros/cons each of them has.
After this talk, you’ll be able to decide which one is the best fit in your context.

DTSTART:20190204T163000

DESCRIPTION:When you’re managing distrubyted applications you’re probably using a variety of tools that serve specific purposes.
Terraform, Helm, Compose, CloudFormation, Pulumi, ARM templates, etc. No one tool solves all your needs.
And new tools come along regularly. But all tools tend to invent there own packaging.
In this talk we’ll introduce the Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB) specification, and some associated tooling.
CNAB embraces the multi-tool world and allows for packaging up multiple formats and their accompanying toolchains into a single artefact.
Imagine a single installable package that contains Terraform code to launch an RDS instance and a Compose file or Helm charts describing the application that will use it.
Today you might package and distribute those separately, with CNAB you can keep them together.
That means we can share metadata, cryptographically sign a single artefact, push all aspects of the application to a central registry and more.
In this talk we’ll introduce CNAB, discuss some of the problems it solves, and show demos of the accompanying tooling.
