DESCRIPTION;ALTREP="https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/battlebreaker/":Battle of the circuit breakers: Istio vs Hystrix
X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>Kubernetes in general, and Istio in particular, have changed a lot the way we look at Ops-related constraints: monitoring,
load-balancing, health checks, etc.
Before those products became available, there were already available solutions to handle those constraints.</p>

<p>Among them is Hystrix, a Java library provided by Netflix.<br />
From the site: &ldquo;Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems,
services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.&rdquo;<br />
In particular, Hystrix provides an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern,
which prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services. But now Istio also provides the same capability.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will have a look at how Istio and Hystrix implement the Circuit Breaker pattern, and what pros/cons each of them has.</p>

<p>After this talk, you&rsquo;ll be able to decide which one is the best fit in your context.</p>

DESCRIPTION;ALTREP="https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/monday/cnab/":CNAB: packaging for distributed applications with multiple toolchains
X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>When you&rsquo;re managing distrubyted applications you&rsquo;re probably using a variety of tools that serve specific purposes.<br />
Terraform, Helm, Compose, CloudFormation, Pulumi, ARM templates, etc. No one tool solves all your needs.<br />
And new tools come along regularly. But all tools tend to invent there own packaging.</p>

<p>In this talk we&rsquo;ll introduce the Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB) specification, and some associated tooling.<br />
CNAB embraces the multi-tool world and allows for packaging up multiple formats and their accompanying toolchains into a single artefact.</p>

<p>Imagine a single installable package that contains Terraform code to launch an RDS instance and a Compose file or
Helm charts describing the application that will use it.<br />
Today you might package and distribute those separately, with CNAB you can keep them together.</p>

<p>That means we can share metadata, cryptographically sign a single artefact, push all aspects of the application to a central registry and more.</p>

<p>In this talk we&rsquo;ll introduce CNAB, discuss some of the problems it solves, and show demos of the accompanying tooling.</p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re working to put in place a Rudder policy that covers all OS that we support at our customers,
or that will be coming around (i.e. beta of a new version).</p>

<p>For our managed systems, it should cover distro-/OS-specific settings and that &ldquo;what makes sense everywhere, will be applied everywhere&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For our human eyes, it should have a clear design that allows for easy understanding and maintenance.</p>

<p>Rudder offers many options to express little details in the policy.<br />
We need to find a best practice for quickly choosing the simplest option, which is least likely to require redesign.</p>

<h3 id="experiences">Experiences</h3>

<ul>
<li>managing kernel module blacklists, managing sysctls</li>
<li>configuring auditd to be safe and lightweight</li>
<li>mixing globally applicable and os-specific Rudder rules</li>
<li>using ncf sys knowledge to abstract OS-specific package and service names out of the policy</li>
<li>independent testing of compliance using Lynis and monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p>** why? because if we (flawed human) design the policy, we (same flawed human) should not design the final test :-) **</p>

<h3 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll wrap it up with practical stuff like configuring OSSEC and why nsjail is awesome as a containment technology for services.<br />
We can help our colleagues and ourselves securing many applications, with a much better learning curve than SElinux etc. got.</p>

<p>So when you walk in the room and listen you get rough idea of sustainable policy design but also of what a sec policy looks like,
if it&rsquo;s not only made to fill a checklist.</p>

Virtual machines for the training labs have gone from manual provisioning through managed by Foreman to Vagrant to get even more flexibility.<br />

It likely involves rewriting all your infrastructure code,

<p>With mgmt&rsquo;s support for Puppet code, migrating becomes a lot more natural.<br />

Security compliance is a state where computer systems are scrutinized against certain defined security policy.<br />
OpenSCAP is one such security compliance ecosystem that provides multiple tools to assist administrators and auditors
with assessment, measurement, and enforcement of security baselines.<br />
Foreman provides OpenSCAP as a plugin that enables Foreman to receive automated vulnerability assessment and
security compliance audits from Foreman hosts. You can upload SCAP compliance contents,
create compliance policies out of them and further, these policies can be assigned to various hosts or hostgroups created through foreman.<br />
OpenSCAP reports will help users find vulnerabilities on the hosts and also suggest remediation plan to fix those vulnerabilities.<br />
Foreman OpenSCAP plugin is made of 4 components viz., foreman_openscap, smart_proxy_openscap, foreman_scap_client and puppet-foreman_scap_client.<br />
These components together establish the Foreman and OpenSCAP integration.</p>

They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily re-factor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.</p>

<p>This talk discusses our options how we can model puppet code while applying the SOLID principles.<br />
As the puppet DSL is not a object oriented language we will also address the limitations of the design pattern,
which we ll have to solve using the convention over configuration design pattern.</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>Stream processing technologies are usually associated with social media, click streams,
machine learning and big data however this talk will show it can be useful in solving difficult
problems operations face when dealing with large server estates.</p>

<p>A very large scale stream processing pipeline have been built managing metadata
for 100s of thousands of nodes using technologies from Choria.io and NATS.io,
this talk will explore the design, performance and potential uses of such a platform.</p>

<p>Areas covered:</p>

<ul>
<li>basic streaming overview</li>
<li>design of the global network</li>
<li>design of a replication tool particular to the needs</li>
<li>building hierarchical cached views of the estate</li>
<li>exposing data to other systems with examples</li>
<li>using stream processing methodologies to perform real time analysis and remediation of the fleet</li>
</ul>

<p>We;ll also explore how this is a good parallel for IoT where the mentioned node scale is considered small.</p>

<p>While this talk demonstrates a platform built using specific technologies and the design of those will influence the talk,
it&rsquo;s not a vendor talk and we’ll make efforts so the ideas are transferred and not the glossies from any one tool.</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>Unikernels are a new class of operating system.<br />
The core idea is to merge the kernel, libraries, and application into a single image binary, operating in a single address space.<br />
This has the potential to improve security, performance, and a few other factors.</p>

<p>For native Unikernel applications, this moves configuration to the build stage.<br />
So how are we supposed to manage these applications?<br />
How should they be configured and deployed?<br />
How can we profile them?<br />
Debug them?<br />
 The talk will start with what a Unikernel is, an overview of the Unikernel landscape and their different characterist.<br />
Where are they heading?<br />
An interesting development is happening with Unikernels sneaking their way onto Linux systems and playing hand-in-hand with more traditional systems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll demo a couple of Unikernel applications.<br />
Show how they are configured and deployed.<br />
What tools exist and what tools are missing.<br />
A bit of talk about the joys and pains of deploying an untested class of operating systems in production.</p>

<p>Open questions for which I have no answers but will solicit feedback are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What existing tools could be used to manage this class of applications?</li>
<li>What class of problems matches the characteristics of Unikernels (Real-time, immutable, small)</li>
</ul>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>To borrow a phrase, &ldquo;In the beginning was the command line.&rdquo; Then we had ISConf and CFEngine, and things were good&hellip; for a while.</p>

<p>Puppet and Chef came along, embodying the idea that infrastructure code should behave like application code.  More
recently, Ansible brought the concept of idempotent resources to imperative workflows, but stops short of modelling in
favor of radical simplicity.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re wondering: is it possible to get the best of both worlds?<br />
Can we get model-based guarantees plus orchestrated action?</p>

<p>I think the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and in this talk I will explore an emerging &ldquo;fourth generation&rdquo; of config management tools
that attempt to bring the beneficial properties of models together with orchestrated action. In full disclosure, I&rsquo;ll
talk about Puppet&rsquo;s Bolt and Lyra projects, but the talk will not be vendor-specific as tools like Terraform and OpsMop
also exemplify this approach.</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>Distributed systems, microservices, containers and schedulers, polyglot persistence &hellip;<br />
modern infrastructure is ever more fluid and dynamic, chaotic and transient.<br />
Likewise, individual engineering roles can no longer be broken down neatly into<br />
software engineers (who write the code) and ops engineers (who deploy the code (and buffer the consequences)).<br />
Many teams have already sailed past an event horizon of complexity and found that their old tools and processes no longer work for them.</p>

<p>But why, exactly?<br />
What was wrong with traditional metrics and logs?<br />
Why are they failing to keep pace with modern requirements?<br />
Isn&rsquo;t observability just a marketing term for monitoring? And what on earth can we do about it?</p>

<p>In this talk we&rsquo;ll cover the shortcomings of traditional metrics and logs,
and the technical and cultural differences between monitoring and observability.<br />
We&rsquo;ll also talk about the deep cultural revolution underway from siloed specialties
towards software ownership (in every type of engineering role) &ndash;
and what exactly does that mean when it comes to systems observability? &ndash;
as well as the technical practices and mental shifts that are absolutely required to keep pace with modern infrastructure.</p>
