SUMMARY:Ops hates containers! Why?
ORGANIZER:Martin Alfke

DESCRIPTION:<p>&ldquo;Docker, Docker, Docker, Docker, &hellip;&rdquo;, developers really love Docker.<br />
Usually one sees the no longer need for configuration management,
the easy way to spin up a platform on a laptop, the low resource footprint.
But how do you deploy laptops in data centers?</p>

<p>This talk will give you an insight how we (more Ops then Dev) started to learn (and love) containers,
the issues we saw when running them in larger scale and how Ops people should start dealing with Container technologies.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Choria is a 2 year old project that started life as an easy route to using MCollective for open source Puppet users.<br />
It has evolved to encompass a number of technologies related to large scale systems management
and have been deployed on globe spanning sites with 100s of thousands of nodes and thousands of daily active users.</p>

<p>This talk will give an update on the projects status, progress, and will explore some of the new technologies created in this project.</p>

<p>With the arrival of Puppet 6 in fall 2018 Puppet Inc has officially deprecated The Marionette Collective and
have donated the legacy MCollective code bases to the Choria project.<br />
We will explore what options Puppet 6 users have for benefiting from their past investments in the MCollective platform and
look at work done that will be of particular interest to Puppet users such as orchestrating nodes using the Puppet DSL using Choria Playbooks.</p>

DESCRIPTION:

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re working to put in place a Rudder policy that covers all OS that we support at our customers,
or that will be coming around (i.e. beta of a new version).</p>

<p>For our managed systems, it should cover distro-/OS-specific settings and that &ldquo;what makes sense everywhere, will be applied everywhere&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For our human eyes, it should have a clear design that allows for easy understanding and maintenance.</p>

<p>Rudder offers many options to express little details in the policy.<br />
We need to find a best practice for quickly choosing the simplest option, which is least likely to require redesign.</p>

<h3 id="experiences">Experiences</h3>

<ul>
<li>managing kernel module blacklists, managing sysctls</li>
<li>configuring auditd to be safe and lightweight</li>
<li>mixing globally applicable and os-specific Rudder rules</li>
<li>using ncf sys knowledge to abstract OS-specific package and service names out of the policy</li>
<li>independent testing of compliance using Lynis and monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p>** why? because if we (flawed human) design the policy, we (same flawed human) should not design the final test :-) **</p>

<h3 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll wrap it up with practical stuff like configuring OSSEC and why nsjail is awesome as a containment technology for services.<br />
We can help our colleagues and ourselves securing many applications, with a much better learning curve than SElinux etc. got.</p>

<p>So when you walk in the room and listen you get rough idea of sustainable policy design but also of what a sec policy looks like,
if it&rsquo;s not only made to fill a checklist.</p>

SUMMARY:Dr SaltStack: or How I Stopped Worrying And Replaced All The Crons
ORGANIZER:Gareth Greenaway
CATEGORIES:talk

DTSTART:20190204T173000Z
DTEND:20190204T182500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>Cron, a popular tool for scheduling jobs, has been used by millions of people on millions of servers around the world for several years.<br />
As servers become less like pets and more like cattle, jobs can no longer be tied to a specific server and
a scheduling system must be flexible to allow jobs to easily be scheduled across multiple servers,
quickly moved from one server to another, and easily report on the status of a scheduled job.</p>

<p>Salt Stack, is at its heart, a remote execution system which also does configuration management very well.<br />
This presentation will demonstrate how Salt can be used to replace Cron for command scheduling and fulfill these modern requirements.</p>

<p>The talk will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A brief introduction to Salt Stack</li>
<li>Examples of how to schedule jobs using Salt Stack.</li>
<li>Using the Salt State system to scheduling jobs with dependencies.</li>
<li>Using Salt Returners to receive notifications on job status.</li>
<li>With Salt&rsquo;s remote execution modules, how to centrally manage jobs across many servers.</li>

DTSTART:20190204T150000Z

DESCRIPTION:<p>Golang as a language has exploded with popularity since it&rsquo;s first release in 2009.<br />
It&rsquo;s now the langauage behind a number of applications core to most organisations operations, such as Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes and etcd.</p>

<p>However, for most people used to scripting interpreted languages like Ruby and Python,
it can be a bit hard to get started with. What&rsquo;s all this err != nil business, and why am I getting errors when I don&rsquo;t refer to a variable?</p>

<p>In this talk, we&rsquo;ll be discussing how to learn enough Golang to get into trouble,
or at least enough to contribute fixes and features to your favourite infra management tools and apps,
with an example of adding a new feature to the Vault Terraform Provider, and the gotcha&rsquo;s you might experience along the way.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Microservice security is too hard.<br />
We must issue and rotate TLS certificates, deploy identity providers, and embed auth logic in applications.<br />
These all require secure development, test, and maintenance effort.<br />
Istio (a Google, IBM, and Lyft project) offers a new way:
by providing a service mesh and a unified identity for each request,
it offers all these things with zero application changes.</p>

<p>In this talk we detail:</p>

<ul>
<li>What a service mesh is, and why Istio could revolutionise microservices</li>
<li>Increasing application security and availability using network RBAC and circuit breakers</li>
<li>Why all applications should use encryption by default</li>
<li>&ldquo;Free&rdquo; mutual TLS between all services and rotate certs every hour</li>
<li>Preventing token replay attacks that plague JWT</li>
<li>Securely delegating requests between microservices</li>

DESCRIPTION:<p>InSpec is an open-source testing framework created by Chef that enables you to specify compliance, security, and other policy requirements.<br />
However, the usage is not limited to compliance checking only as you can also use it to validate systems.<br />
And, as InSpec is code which is very readable and easy to implement it can be used in a lot of different cases.<br />
For a DevOps engineer it is a must have to tool which can be used together with Chef, Puppet or Ansible.<br />
We will go over the language, use cases along with short demo&rsquo;s.</p>

DTSTART:20190204T173000Z
DTEND:20190204T182500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>Have you longed for a simple yet powerful way to automate workloads on Kubernetes?<br />
Ansible, the familiar IT automation tool, makes it easier than ever to automate your cluster.<br />
This talk introduces two practical ways to define and provision complex applications using Ansible Automation with Kubernetes.</p>

<p>The Automation Broker allows users to leverage Ansible Automation to define and orchestrate applications,
making them available for self-service provisioning in the Service Catalog.</p>

<p>The Ansible Operator allows users to actively manage the full lifecycle of an application by defining management behaviors with Ansible;
the Operator handles everything else.</p>

<p>In this session you will learn:
- How to define and deploy your application on Kubernetes using Ansible.
- How to publish your own applications in the Kubernetes Service Catalog.
- How to create a Kubernetes Operator using Ansible.</p>

SUMMARY:Drilling down a software bug: lessons about observability, monitoring, automation and good practices

DTSTART:20190204T163000Z

DESCRIPTION:<p>So, there is case, every once in a few days the kafka cluster dies and
along dies the whole application resulting in revenue loss for the company.</p>

<p>Starting there, I would like to describe how we approached the unknown issue, assumptions, failure, trial and error,
until we found the root cause: a known bug in the respective version of the famous distributed software.<br />
Of course, every software has bugs and hitting a major one is not such uncommon but more than that,
what is actually important is the actual lessons learnt during the process:</p>

<ul>
<li>how do we monitor our infrastructure and ways to improve it</li>
<li>what actually happens inside our application, how do failures of external software affect it, how we can improve stability</li>
<li>tools we have Vs tools we need, call for more automation</li>
<li>what are the actual resources we need for our use case, if we under/overprovision, understand our scale and optimize the costs</li>
<li>importance of documentation and post-mortems, the 5 WHYs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Major takeaway of this talk:
tackle your incidents as a way to understand more about your systems
(both technical systems: infra, code, tools AND non-technical systems: teams, workflows, procedures, practices) and design them better.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>This talk will show a uncommon case study for Foreman at NETWAYS.<br />
Our training schedule is fully packed with public and in-house training courses and
having many different topics requires us to change training environments quite often and
in short time to get them to different locations.<br />
Moving away from golden images to Foreman and Puppet has enabled our Events team to provision training environments independently from technical stuff.<br />
The Discovery Plugin allows to use the same process for handling rental notebooks for in-house training courses and big conference.<br />
Virtual machines for the training labs have gone from manual provisioning through managed by Foreman to Vagrant to get even more flexibility.<br />
And the latest step to reduce the need for re-provisioning is by using LVM snapshots and downloading Virtual Machine images from the cloud.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Kubernetes with Kubevirt is the uprising solution for unified management of virtual machines and containers.</p>

<p>Foreman is well known as a complete life cycle systems management tool for provisioning, configuring and monitoring of physical and virtual servers.</p>

<p>The talk will focus on the newly added support for Kubevirt in Foreman which allows provisioning and configuration of Virtual Servers on top of Kubernetes with Kubevirt.</p>

<p>After describing the use-cases and the supported functionality provided by the integration, I intend to show a demo that combines all of the pieces and the interaction between them.</p>

<p>The demo will show how a virtual server is being created from Foreman, adding a VM on KubeVirt compute resource and provision its OS from PXE.</p>

<p>The setup is a bit complex due to the nature of the moving parts and those will be explained as well prior to the demo.</p>

It likely involves rewriting all your infrastructure code,
and will either require a scary over-night cut-off, or a period in which two tools run concurrently,
with operators carefully shifting functionality one step at a time.</p>

<p>With mgmt&rsquo;s support for Puppet code, migrating becomes a lot more natural.<br />

DESCRIPTION:<p>Systems left with unpatched vulnerabilities can have a number of consequences.<br />
Security compliance is a state where computer systems are scrutinized against certain defined security policy.<br />
OpenSCAP is one such security compliance ecosystem that provides multiple tools to assist administrators and auditors
with assessment, measurement, and enforcement of security baselines.<br />
Foreman provides OpenSCAP as a plugin that enables Foreman to receive automated vulnerability assessment and
security compliance audits from Foreman hosts. You can upload SCAP compliance contents,
create compliance policies out of them and further, these policies can be assigned to various hosts or hostgroups created through foreman.<br />
OpenSCAP reports will help users find vulnerabilities on the hosts and also suggest remediation plan to fix those vulnerabilities.<br />
Foreman OpenSCAP plugin is made of 4 components viz., foreman_openscap, smart_proxy_openscap, foreman_scap_client and puppet-foreman_scap_client.<br />
These components together establish the Foreman and OpenSCAP integration.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.<br />
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily re-factor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.</p>

<p>This talk discusses our options how we can model puppet code while applying the SOLID principles.<br />
As the puppet DSL is not a object oriented language we will also address the limitations of the design pattern,
which we ll have to solve using the convention over configuration design pattern.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Google has been practicing Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) since the early 2000&rsquo;s,
but only recently began speaking about it publicly.<br />
Some have called SRE &lsquo;DevOps 2.0&rsquo;, while others view it as a competing standard.<br />
This talk discusses the differences and similarities between DevOps and SRE.</p>

SUMMARY:Introducing 'object-oriented operations' for community-driven infrastructure-as-code
ORGANIZER:Mark Shuttleworth
CATEGORIES:keynote
DTSTAMP:20181227T000000Z
DTSTART:20190204T120000Z
DTEND:20190204T125500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>Infrastructure as code is a proven pattern,
and so is open source. Wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense to bring a community driven approach to operational code itself?</p>

<p>This talk is about bringing those ideas together,
to create effective open source communities for operational code on Kubernetes and on traditional machine or cloud environments.<br />
Collaborating on complex infrastructure, and using open source to share the benefits of that collaboration,
will enable us all to spend more time focused on the things which are truly different about our challenges and less on the problems we all share.</p>

DTSTART:20190204T110000Z
DTEND:20190204T115500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>First we had CFEngine, and things were good&hellip; for a while.</p>

<p>Then Puppet and Chef came along, embodying the idea that infrastructure code should behave like application code.<br />
More recently, Ansible brought the concept of idempotent resources to imperative workflows,
but stops short of modelling in the name of simplicity.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re wondering: is it possible to get the best of both worlds?<br />
Can we get model-based guarantees plus orchestrated action?<br />
I think the answer is yes, and as a case study I will take a tour through history and dive into Bolt,
an open-source project started by Puppet in 2017, that has rapidly evolved to bring these two worlds together.<br />
I&rsquo;ll talk through the design principles behind Bolt, walk through some code examples, and maybe even live demo &hellip;</p>

DTEND:20190204T172500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>In this talk I will go in details about how we quickly resolve incidents using Prometheus and ansible.</p>

<p>Come and discover how we linked the monitoring, queuing systems and orchestration to do unattended incident management.</p>

<p>One of the main advantages of this is that we can apply technical remediation or mitigation from business metrics,
even if things happen at different levels.</p>

<p>All of this working anywhere Prometheus and ansible run, so not only in a kube env, but also in a traditional infrastructure.</p>

velocity and frequent code deployments are king.<br />
That means frequent deploys and the need to make that happen mostly automatically.<br />
Rollbacks are mandatory. Everything should be automated, streamlined and audited.<br />
Today i will show you one way to do a blue/green deploymnet allowing high velocity and flexibility.<br />
If demo Gods allow it we will even see it in action.</p>

SUMMARY:CNAB: packaging for distributed applications with multiple toolchains
ORGANIZER:Gareth Rushgrove

DTSTAMP:00010101T000000Z
DTSTART:20190204T163000Z
DTEND:20190204T172500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>When you&rsquo;re managing distrubyted applications you&rsquo;re probably using a variety of tools that serve specific purposes.<br />
Terraform, Helm, Compose, CloudFormation, Pulumi, ARM templates, etc. No one tool solves all your needs.<br />
And new tools come along regularly. But all tools tend to invent there own packaging.</p>

<p>In this talk we&rsquo;ll introduce the Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB) specification, and some associated tooling.<br />
CNAB embraces the multi-tool world and allows for packaging up multiple formats and their accompanying toolchains into a single artefact.</p>

<p>Imagine a single installable package that contains Terraform code to launch an RDS instance and a Compose file or
Helm charts describing the application that will use it.<br />
Today you might package and distribute those separately, with CNAB you can keep them together.</p>

<p>That means we can share metadata, cryptographically sign a single artefact, push all aspects of the application to a central registry and more.</p>

<p>In this talk we&rsquo;ll introduce CNAB, discuss some of the problems it solves, and show demos of the accompanying tooling.</p>
