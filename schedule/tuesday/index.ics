Already well known to the system community, Salt has reached its maturity on the network automation side as well.<br />
Today, Salt natively provides integrations with well-known open-source libraries and tools,
including: NAPALM, NetBox, Netmiko, Junos PyEZ (junos-eznc), Arista pyeapi, CiscoConfParse, as well as features for PeeringDB, and many others.<br />

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>For a long time now, a common refrain in the #puppet IRC and now Slack channels has been explaining
how Puppet functions run during compilation on the master and not on the agent.<br />
No, really. Not on the agent.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s still true.<br />
Because running functions on the master means that the catalog is a complete representation of the state we want on the node.<br />
But&hellip; sometimes there are things that we just can&rsquo;t put in the catalog, or have to be computed on the agent.<br />
Puppet 6 introduces the concept of Deferred functions, to be run during the catalog enforcement.</p>

<p>In this talk I&rsquo;ll show how that can be used to manage secrets on the node, without the master ever knowing those secrets.<br />
I&rsquo;ll also walk through the process of updating my popular node_encrypt module, which encrypts secrets as they pass through the catalog,
to use Deferred functions to decrypt those secrets agent side, vastly broadening its capabilities.</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>Most organizations feel the need to centralize their logs -
once you have more than a couple of servers or containers,
SSH and tail will not serve you well any more.<br />
However, the common question or struggle is how to achieve that.</p>

<p>This talk presents multiple approaches and patterns with their advantages and disadvantages,
so you can pick the one that fits your organization best:</p>

<ul>
<li>Parse: Take the log files of your applications and extract the relevant pieces of information.</li>
<li>Send: Add a log appender to send out your events directly without persisting them to a log file.</li>
<li>Structure: Write your events in a structured file, which you can then centralize.</li>
<li>Containerize: Keep track of short lived containers and configure their logging correctly.</li>
<li>Orchestrate: Stay on top of your logs even when services are short lived and dynamically allocated on Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each pattern has its own demo with the open source Elastic Stack (previously called ELK Stack),
so you can easily try out the different approaches in your environment.<br />
Though the general patterns are applicable with any centralized logging system.</p>

along dies the whole application resulting in revenue loss for the company.</p>

<p>Starting there, I would like to describe how we approached the unknown issue, assumptions, failure, trial and error,
until we found the root cause: a known bug in the respective version of the famous distributed software.<br />
Of course, every software has bugs and hitting a major one is not such uncommon but more than that,
what is actually important is the actual lessons learnt during the process:</p>

<ul>
<li>how do we monitor our infrastructure and ways to improve it</li>
<li>what actually happens inside our application, how do failures of external software affect it, how we can improve stability</li>
<li>tools we have Vs tools we need, call for more automation</li>
<li>what are the actual resources we need for our use case, if we under/overprovision, understand our scale and optimize the costs</li>
<li>importance of documentation and post-mortems, the 5 WHYs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Major takeaway of this talk:
tackle your incidents as a way to understand more about your systems
(both technical systems: infra, code, tools AND non-technical systems: teams, workflows, procedures, practices) and design them better.</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>As DevOps practices and modern software defined infrastructure become increasingly established in enterprises,
and as the scale of delivery grows, practitioners increasingly find themselves drawn into traditional IT support structures.<br />
Here, they find themselves expected to act as part of a classic multi-tier support structure,
with at least part of their time spent acting as a 3rd line support function.</p>

<p>This presentation explores the problems this creates:
its siloed nature creates inefficient work-in-progress queues,
and reduces cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p>

<p>Service Management plays a vital role in managing system consumers at scale,
but it needs to modernise to work well in the new era.<br />
Hence, this presentation explores emergent methods such as Swarming,
and new thinking such as Cynefin, which bring new thinking and new structures which align much better to modern development and operations thinking.</p>

<h3 id="lander-van-den-bulcke">Lander Van den Bulcke</h3>

<p>In order to optimize your continous delivery pipelines, and to make sure your delivery actually is continuous,
it can be useful to collect some metrics about your pipelines.
In addition to discussing which metrics are potentially useful and how they can be used to improve your workflow,
we will look at the basics of Prometheus and how it can be used to monitor Jenkins jobs/pipelines,
and even how it can alert the relevant people when all isn&rsquo;t hunky-dory.</p>

<h2 id="forget-yaml-write-all-of-your-configuration-in-typescript">Forget YAML. Write all of your configuration in Typescript</h2>

<h3 id="gareth-rushgrove">Gareth Rushgrove</h3>

<p>Managing configuration by manipulating data structures by hand is popular.
YAML currently rules all around us.
But what if you could write and maintain configuration in a high-level programming language and
simply generate the configuration for your YAML-hungry application? What if that language was Typescript?
In this talk we&rsquo;ll quickly introduce TypeScript (Familiar syntax! Types! Fantastic IDE integrations!) and
show a few examples of making a YAML-based configuration file more exciting.
We&rsquo;ll also discuss how that facilitates powerful sharing and reuse of configuration,
and even creating your own higher-level abstractions.</p>

<p>In this ignite David will do a quick run through the major innovations in Configuration Management in 2018.
Expect a sparkly firework of features, value added, satisfied customers and robust goodness.
David will also tell the story of Frank, a sysadmin, and what he thinks of those features.</p>

As part of an ignite talk I want to give a brief overview of our work in order to possibly spark interest,
so that people in the audience might carry this idea on to see whether they can / want to do such work in their country.</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:@"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN""><HTML><BODY><p>These days &ldquo;infrastructure as code&rdquo; means HCL, YAML, JSON.<br />
I will never buy that JSON is a programming language.<br />
Cloud Formation tries so hard mixing JSON with keywords that runtime become functions saying that it is a maintainable approach.<br />
Helm pushes hard saying that YAML with some parameters that runtime get translated to a variable is a flexible and maintainable approach.<br />
Infrastructure as code means that you are supposed to use a programming language because otherwise, it won&rsquo;t work.<br />
Some YAML evangelists will tell you that a &ldquo;human-friendly data serialization standard&rdquo; is better than code
because it will keep you out from writing weird and wrong code that you are not supposed to write doing infrastructure.<br />
The truth is that you need to code better! At InfluxData we know that,
and this talk is about our journey moving from YAML to Go to manage our Kubernetes cluster.<br />
What we faced and why we think it is way better!</p>
