SUMMARY:Pulp Users Love Plugins
ORGANIZER:Matthias Dellweg
CATEGORIES:talk

DTEND:20190205T182500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>Benefits fueled by the modularity of the pulp plugin ecosystem by taking the example of pulp_deb and pulp_gem.</p>

<p>Pulp is a rest-api driven, plugin based framework for content repository management.<br />
Despite being used unmediated, it is also employed as a key backend component in foreman/katello.<br />
Its complete rewrite, needing a reimplementation of all content plugins, invites for experimentation with new technologies.<br />
In this talk we introduce the new version of one of those plugins for debian packages, with its unique challenges.<br />
Also we compare with a completely new one for rubygems.</p>

SUMMARY:Agent-side functions in Puppet 6. Wait, that's a thing?
ORGANIZER:Ben Ford
CATEGORIES:talk
DTSTAMP:20181231T000000Z
DTSTART:20190205T150000Z
DTEND:20190205T155500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>For a long time now, a common refrain in the #puppet IRC and now Slack channels has been explaining
how Puppet functions run during compilation on the master and not on the agent.<br />
No, really. Not on the agent.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s still true.<br />
Because running functions on the master means that the catalog is a complete representation of the state we want on the node.<br />
But&hellip; sometimes there are things that we just can&rsquo;t put in the catalog, or have to be computed on the agent.<br />
Puppet 6 introduces the concept of Deferred functions, to be run during the catalog enforcement.</p>

<p>In this talk I&rsquo;ll show how that can be used to manage secrets on the node, without the master ever knowing those secrets.<br />
I&rsquo;ll also walk through the process of updating my popular node_encrypt module, which encrypts secrets as they pass through the catalog,
to use Deferred functions to decrypt those secrets agent side, vastly broadening its capabilities.</p>

SUMMARY:Building a self healing system with SaltStack
ORGANIZER:Gareth Greenaway
CATEGORIES:talk
DTSTAMP:20181231T000000Z
DTSTART:20190205T140000Z
DTEND:20190205T145500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>As the number of servers that we are responsible for increases,
the ability to manage issues on those systems becomes more and more difficult.<br />
Situations arise like log files filling up disks,
failed login attempts that could be brute force attacks,
and unwanted processes and services running.</p>

<p>Using the Beacon system of SaltStack, we can monitor a system for these &amp; other scenarios.<br />
Pairing this with the Reactor system, we can have SaltStack remediate those systems to the desired state.</p>

<p>In this talk, we&rsquo;ll look at some real-life examples if these scenarios and how Saltstack can help to automatically heal the systems.</p>

<p>The talk will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A brief introduction to Salt Stack.</li>
<li>Using Salt Beacons to monitor aspects of a system.</li>
<li>Using Salt Reactors to react to events from the Salt Beacons.</li>
<li>Using those reactors to remediate issues as they occur.</li>

SUMMARY:Centralized Logging Patterns

DTSTAMP:20181231T000000Z
DTSTART:20190205T150000Z
DTEND:20190205T155500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>Most organizations feel the need to centralize their logs -
once you have more than a couple of servers or containers,
SSH and tail will not serve you well any more.<br />
However, the common question or struggle is how to achieve that.</p>

<p>This talk presents multiple approaches and patterns with their advantages and disadvantages,
so you can pick the one that fits your organization best:</p>

<ul>
<li>Parse: Take the log files of your applications and extract the relevant pieces of information.</li>
<li>Send: Add a log appender to send out your events directly without persisting them to a log file.</li>
<li>Structure: Write your events in a structured file, which you can then centralize.</li>
<li>Containerize: Keep track of short lived containers and configure their logging correctly.</li>
<li>Orchestrate: Stay on top of your logs even when services are short lived and dynamically allocated on Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each pattern has its own demo with the open source Elastic Stack (previously called ELK Stack),
so you can easily try out the different approaches in your environment.<br />
Though the general patterns are applicable with any centralized logging system.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Katello, a plugin to The Foreman, provides package repositories to clients,
allows repository snapshots and can present these snapshots to different client groups.<br />
This, together with an extensive Ansible integration, allows for easy automation of the whole lifecycle of a package,
from build, though integration testing down to the clients in QA and Production.</p>

<p>In this talk we will show how you can build out such a setup, integrate with your build services,
spin up your test environment with the newly created package-set and promote the packages to the next level as soon as all tests are green.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>An overview over InnoGames infrastructure and the tools we build.</p>

<p>At InnoGames we have to keep track of three collocations,
~30 racks with thousands of VMs to run games for over 200 million registered users.<br />
We have to manage our self hosted as well as various external services and preferably do so in a way that does not wake our oncall admin at 3am.</p>

<p>All our infrastructure is configured via a central configuration management database.<br />
We use that database to keep track of physical and virtual machines, network equipment and configuration, monitoring and much more.<br />
We have open sourced our configuration management database [0], as well as our tooling for managing KVM VMs [1].<br />
What makes serveradmin unique is how easy it is to modify the database schema as well as its very easy to use and fast API.</p>

<p>This talk will:</p>

<ul>
<li>give you an overview over our infrastructure and custom tooling.</li>
<li>explain our approach to API driven infrastructure automation.</li>
<li>show you how to model your infrastructure in serveradmin.</li>
<li>demonstrate creation, deletion and live migration of KVM VMs.</li>

but that doesn’t mean that they all suit your needs perfectly.<br />
By extending Salt with your own modules or building enhancements into existing ones,
you can bring the functionality that you need to increase your productivity.<br />
In this talk, first, we&rsquo;ll start by looking at the Loader system that drives Salt and how we could add an entire new subsystem.<br />
Then we&rsquo;ll move onto writing a new remote execution module and then look at how we can use our remote execution module
in a state module for configuration management.<br />
Finally, we&rsquo;ll take a look at how to extend some of the other subsystems of Salt such as engines, beacons, and returners.</p>

Because running Ansible is awkward, we wrote a wrapper in Python named obal.<br />
This allows us to provide a clean command line interface with help texts that allow self discovery of the options.<br />
While the tool bundles our packaging playbooks, it is designed to be able to use any Ansible playbook.<br />

DESCRIPTION:<p>As DevOps practices and modern software defined infrastructure become increasingly established in enterprises,
and as the scale of delivery grows, practitioners increasingly find themselves drawn into traditional IT support structures.<br />
Here, they find themselves expected to act as part of a classic multi-tier support structure,
with at least part of their time spent acting as a 3rd line support function.</p>

<p>This presentation explores the problems this creates:
its siloed nature creates inefficient work-in-progress queues,
and reduces cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p>

<p>Service Management plays a vital role in managing system consumers at scale,
but it needs to modernise to work well in the new era.<br />
Hence, this presentation explores emergent methods such as Swarming,
and new thinking such as Cynefin, which bring new thinking and new structures which align much better to modern development and operations thinking.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>More and more services expose their state, internal details and metrics to be observable, and improve overall quality of service.<br />
But what about observing the infrastructure they are deployed, configured and maintained on?<br />
What can we learn from that, and what do we need from configuration management to get these features and metrics?</p>

<p>Logs from installation is a good start, but they need centralization, aggregation and especially knowledge derivation from these -
but also we need to observe these features over time, to trace changes, and correlate them with monitoring.</p>

<p>Rudder was built around the predicate that all actions of the configuration agent need to be traced,
centralized and exposed in a meaningful way - with agents ensuring the continuous configuration of systems,
and this talk will show the rationale behind this predicate, how we implemented this solution,
and the benefits of this approach for the modern IT world.</p>

<li>we challenged the necessity of some features: this allowed us to simplify the setup,
reuse tooling/systems from bare-metal infra and have directly addressable pods; - we focused on monitoring and observability:
we wrote custom probes (unit and integration tests) verifying first the user experience monitored with SLOs.<br /></li>

<p>I want to give an overview of the current state of affairs:
What exists in the CMDB landscape within the scope of open source solutions and
why companies still write a lot of these solutions themselves to tackle their specific needs.<br />
Furthermore I want to elaborate on what I think is actually needed when looking at the subject of asset management and
when there is actually a need for a CMDB.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Tarmak is an open-source toolkit for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management.<br />
It is focused on best-practice cluster security, management and operation.<br />
This talk will clarify the reasoning behind creating Tarmak, the architecture and technologies used.<br />
With Tarmak we tried to not reinvent the full wheel,
that is why we have chosen to depend on a lot open-source tools (Terraform, Puppet, Vault, &hellip;).<br />
This talk will explain how all of this is tied together.</p>

SUMMARY:kr8: Kubernetes Configuration Management
ORGANIZER:Lee Briggs
CATEGORIES:talk
DTSTAMP:20181228T000000Z
DTSTART:20190205T163000Z
DTEND:20190205T172500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>The abstraction layer for Configuration Management is moving away from the operating system to the orchestration layer,
but the configuration management tools aren&rsquo;t keeping up.<br />
As the number of Kubernetes clusters you run grows,
your ability to install components on them with slight and subtle differences becomes more and more manual.</p>

<p>kr8 is designed to take the heavy lifting out of this,
by allowing you to manipulate yaml with a first class data templating language (jsonnet) without all the overhead of similar tools.<br />
It follows the principles of simplicity you&rsquo;d expect from a bunch of admins writing a tool,
while still allowing the power and flexibility to get what you need done.</p>

<p>This talk will go over the inspiration behind kr8,
as well as show a practical demo and example of deploying the components
you choose to multiple clusters with the modifications needed in a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Lets be honest, whether consisouly or not we all do it.
In this talk we ll discuss how stupid crazy i a managed to go, while serving only a single static html page.</p>

<h2 id="monitoring-your-jenkins-pipelines-using-prometheus">Monitoring your Jenkins pipelines using Prometheus</h2>

<h3 id="lander-van-den-bulcke">Lander Van den Bulcke</h3>

<p>In order to optimize your continous delivery pipelines, and to make sure your delivery actually is continuous,
it can be useful to collect some metrics about your pipelines.
In addition to discussing which metrics are potentially useful and how they can be used to improve your workflow,
we will look at the basics of Prometheus and how it can be used to monitor Jenkins jobs/pipelines,
and even how it can alert the relevant people when all isn&rsquo;t hunky-dory.</p>

<h2 id="forget-yaml-write-all-of-your-configuration-in-typescript">Forget YAML. Write all of your configuration in Typescript</h2>

<h3 id="gareth-rushgrove">Gareth Rushgrove</h3>

<p>Managing configuration by manipulating data structures by hand is popular.
YAML currently rules all around us.
But what if you could write and maintain configuration in a high-level programming language and
simply generate the configuration for your YAML-hungry application? What if that language was Typescript?
In this talk we&rsquo;ll quickly introduce TypeScript (Familiar syntax! Types! Fantastic IDE integrations!) and
show a few examples of making a YAML-based configuration file more exciting.
We&rsquo;ll also discuss how that facilitates powerful sharing and reuse of configuration,
and even creating your own higher-level abstractions.</p>

<h2 id="narcissus-a-go-library-to-manage-configuration-files">Narcissus, a go library to manage configuration files</h2>

<p>In this ignite David will do a quick run through the major innovations in Configuration Management in 2018.
Expect a sparkly firework of features, value added, satisfied customers and robust goodness.
David will also tell the story of Frank, a sysadmin, and what he thinks of those features.</p>

SUMMARY:Infrastructure as code should contain code
ORGANIZER:Gianluca Arbezzano
CATEGORIES:talk
DTSTAMP:20181227T000000Z
DTSTART:20190205T112000Z
DTEND:20190205T121500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>These days &ldquo;infrastructure as code&rdquo; means HCL, YAML, JSON.<br />
I will never buy that JSON is a programming language.<br />
Cloud Formation tries so hard mixing JSON with keywords that runtime become functions saying that it is a maintainable approach.<br />
Helm pushes hard saying that YAML with some parameters that runtime get translated to a variable is a flexible and maintainable approach.<br />
Infrastructure as code means that you are supposed to use a programming language because otherwise, it won&rsquo;t work.<br />
Some YAML evangelists will tell you that a &ldquo;human-friendly data serialization standard&rdquo; is better than code
because it will keep you out from writing weird and wrong code that you are not supposed to write doing infrastructure.<br />
The truth is that you need to code better! At InfluxData we know that,
and this talk is about our journey moving from YAML to Go to manage our Kubernetes cluster.<br />
What we faced and why we think it is way better!</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>I started my first job as an operations engineer 18 months ago and
I had all of those questions and many more.<br />
Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role and
a DevOps team has been a fascinating journey.<br />
I&rsquo;d like to share the lessons I learned along the way and encourage more people to blur the traditional lines.</p>

<p>What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from unconventional background?
- How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles?
- How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management?</p>

SUMMARY:Configuration and configuration management with Unikernels

DTSTART:20190205T150000Z
DTEND:20190205T155500Z
DESCRIPTION:<p>Unikernels are a new class of operating system.<br />
The core idea is to merge the kernel, libraries, and application into a single image binary, operating in a single address space.<br />
This has the potential to improve security, performance, and a few other factors.</p>

<p>For native Unikernel applications, this moves configuration to the build stage.<br />
So how are we supposed to manage these applications?<br />
How should they be configured and deployed?<br />
How can we profile them?<br />
Debug them?<br />
 The talk will start with what a Unikernel is, an overview of the Unikernel landscape and their different characterist.<br />
Where are they heading?<br />
An interesting development is happening with Unikernels sneaking their way onto Linux systems and playing hand-in-hand with more traditional systems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll demo a couple of Unikernel applications.<br />
Show how they are configured and deployed.<br />
What tools exist and what tools are missing.<br />
A bit of talk about the joys and pains of deploying an untested class of operating systems in production.</p>

<p>Open questions for which I have no answers but will solicit feedback are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What existing tools could be used to manage this class of applications?</li>
<li>What class of problems matches the characteristics of Unikernels (Real-time, immutable, small)</li>
</ul>

We have since open sourced many components, fixes and features in collaboration with other networks.<br />
Salt is now one of the most widely-adopted open-source automating frameworks within the network community.<br />
Already well known to the system community, Salt has reached its maturity on the network automation side as well.<br />
Today, Salt natively provides integrations with well-known open-source libraries and tools,
including: NAPALM, NetBox, Netmiko, Junos PyEZ (junos-eznc), Arista pyeapi, CiscoConfParse, as well as features for PeeringDB, and many others.<br />
In this talk, we&rsquo;ll take a look back at the progress, changes and the evolution over the past years, as well as a brief look at potential future features.</p>
