Monitoring your Jenkins pipelines using Prometheus Lander Van den Bulcke In order to optimize your continous delivery pipelines, and to make sure your delivery actually is continuous, it can be useful to collect some metrics about your pipelines. In addition to discussing which metrics are potentially useful and how they can be used to improve your workflow, we will look at the basics of Prometheus and how it can be used to monitor Jenkins jobs/pipelines, and even how it can alert the relevant people when all isn’t hunky-dory.
Forget YAML. Write all of your configuration in Typescript Gareth Rushgrove Managing configuration by manipulating data structures by hand is popular. YAML currently rules all around us. But what if you could write and maintain configuration in a high-level programming language and simply generate the configuration for your YAML-hungry application? What if that language was Typescript? In this talk we’ll quickly introduce TypeScript (Familiar syntax! Types! Fantastic IDE integrations!) and show a few examples of making a YAML-based configuration file more exciting. We’ll also discuss how that facilitates powerful sharing and reuse of configuration, and even creating your own higher-level abstractions.
